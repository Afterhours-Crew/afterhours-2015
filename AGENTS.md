# Project instructions

Read README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md, then inspect git status before making changes.
Preserve existing work. This repository is the canonical home of the server and
all first-party runtime dependencies. Promote settled, tested components
incrementally; do not wait for a complete working server.

Keep research artifacts, raw captures, extracted game content, game binaries,
disassembly, profiles, databases, credentials and private notebook/history out
of commits. Tests here use self-contained constructed data. Never introduce a
build/runtime dependency on a private repository or sibling research checkout.
Record private provenance and reference comparisons in the research workspace.

Use a `codex/` feature branch based on the latest default branch. Commit and push
completed checkpoints and open/update their pull requests. Do not commit or push
directly to the default branch, force-push an open PR or merge without the owner.
Stage explicit paths and review the complete diff before pushing.

Follow CONTRIBUTING.md for architecture, ownership, dependency and testing rules.
Run all three listed Cargo gates for code changes. State exactly what has been
tested; passing library tests does not establish game or offline-play acceptance.
