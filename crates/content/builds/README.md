# Build profiles

Each file describes **one executable build** of the game. Values here are not
game content: they are build-specific identifiers the content builder needs
and cannot read from the installed data files. They change whenever the
executable changes, so every supported build gets its own file.

File name: `<executable stem, lower case>-<first 16 hex digits of its SHA-256>.json`,
for example `nfs16-92aa6ff4b5f8d0f0.json`.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `format`, `version` | `nfs-build-profile`, `1` |
| `description` | Human-readable identification of the build |
| `executable`, `executable_sha256` | File name in the installation root and its exact digest |
| `world_mac_template.rva`, `.sha256` | Relative virtual address (hex) of the 64-byte world MAC template inside the executable image, and the digest the bytes must have. The bytes themselves are read from the player's executable, never stored here |
| `blueprint_class_ids` | Runtime class IDs the client assigns to Blueprint classes. Asset catalogs and asset references sent to the client use them; they are not stored in the content containers |

Only the classes whose IDs are known are listed; building content that needs
another class fails with an explicit error rather than guessing.

To add a build: create its file with every field, add it to `PROFILES` in
`src/builds.rs`, and keep the tests passing (they validate every profile).
Content documents for that build also need the loaders to accept its hash.
