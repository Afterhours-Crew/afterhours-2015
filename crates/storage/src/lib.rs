//! Local persistence port for account-owned server state.
//!
//! One durable store per stable local account holds the player's owned item
//! inventory: reference id, 16-byte definition GUID, owner, default items,
//! sub-items, state, buy and sell price, plus an opaque class-specific body.
//! Account identity comes from local configuration, never from a
//! wire value.
//!
//! The port is synchronous and free of Tokio: the server runs it off its async
//! workers. Two adapters implement the same [`InventoryRepository`] contract
//! and the same pure transition ([`port::transition`], [`port::decide`]):
//! [`memory::MemoryRepository`] for tests and [`sqlite::SqliteRepository`] for
//! durable state (one versioned SQLite file per account, transactional batches,
//! commit before acknowledgement, batch ids for retry safety).
//!
//! Bounds are local policy, not recovered native maxima. Nothing here claims
//! game persistence: a controlled change surviving a server and game restart
//! remains a separate live acceptance test.
